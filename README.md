# My Filters
**Beta: This Repo is in 'beta', as I am working on moving all my lists here.**

Where I am storing all of my Filterlists

Lots of new things are coming soon!

## Installation

These lists are 100% compatible with AdGuard and uBlock Origin, but only some are compatible with Pi-Hole. Since each software is different, I can't tell you how to add them. There are tutorials all over the web.

## Filterlists
Here are all the URLs of my filters

## Whitelists
Alongside the blacklists I maintain, I also make whitelists. I have one large whitelist, and several smaller ones. I am still working on them.
