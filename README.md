# Blockd

Blockd is a collection of DNS filter lists aimed at improving your browsing experience by blocking unwanted content. These filterlists are created using a list I made myself, and it also combines popular lists maintained by others. It cleans the lists up, and applys a whitelist to prevent false positives.
