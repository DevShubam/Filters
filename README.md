# My Filters
**Beta: This Repo is in 'beta', as I am working on moving all my lists here.**

Where I am storing all of my Filterlists

Lots of new things are coming soon!

## Tools

Tools I use

https://abpvn.com/ruleChecker/redundantRuleChecker.html Check for redundant rules!

## Installation

These lists are 100% compatible with AdGuard and uBlock Origin, but only some are compatible with Pi-Hole. Since each software is different, I can't tell you how to add them. There are tutorials all over the web.
